It comes with a fridge, microwave, electric kettle, and lots of in room amenities so you can self cater. So much charm.",

(It overlooks but is not part of East Oakland, which is further south and to the west.) You can hear the Mills College bells ring each quarter hour. <br /><br />Our neighbors include a ferry boat captain, a famous Mission mural painter, digital consultants for political campaigns, and a wellness oriented chiropractor. <br /><br />Almost all of the buildings on our street are single family, middle class homes ($1.1M in the Bay Area) occupied by long time residents. These include Asian, Latino, black, and white residents and families - we are the most ethnically diverse zip code in the Bay Area. You'll see them all walking dogs on the street. <br /><br />There's a wonderful natural foods grocery store about 10 minutes away by car - Farmer Joe's has two locations. Further away, there are many other great purveyors - Berkeley Bowl and Rockridge Market Hall. <br /",

I'm passionate about teaching and spreading the joy of dance, especially partner dance.  I also collect rare plants and have a beautiful and interesting (if a tad unruly) garden, which I tend to all by myself, hence the unruly part.  I love to cook, but my diet is pretty basic, mostly plants, simply prepared with very little processed foods.  I'm a good conversationalist, but my schedule is erratic, so no guarantee I'll be around when you want to talk.  Happy to supply you with all the info you want about the area!  I can't live without good friends, integrity, laughter, dancing, new things to try, and nature.  When I travel, it's usually dance related, although I did achieve my dream of an English country garden tour a few years ago.   I spent the month of July in Sweden and Norway for 8 years studying a European jazz dance (boogie woogie) that I fell in love with.  My home is a quiet space, good for people who want to rest when they get back to their room, not good for people who want to party in their room, rather than on the town. (Also not good for smokers.  Please see house rules if you smoke.)",

In my free time I like to cook, garden, practice yoga and see live music when ever posible. My motto is: Be kinder than necessary , for everyone you meet is fighting some kind of battle.  I tend to be pretty mellow and consider myself open minded.",

We both love to listen to music and watch British television programs!  We are well travelled around the world and enjoy meeting people from all over! When we traveled (before airbnb existed) our favorite thing was wondering into a town we had never been to before and finding a random B&B for the night.  We have some great memories of experiencing the world's towns by getting up close and person with the people. Now we use airbnb for our travel plans!  We love to eat, but we can't live without coffee, and chocolate is nearly as important!  ",

My love of baking began when I was just 4 years old and spent much of my time at my mother's side while she worked in The Vienna Bakery of Tempe, AZ.  Little did I know I would move from art and dance to baking as my life's work. \r\n\r\nAlong with baking, I love the outdoors and am most happy when I am hiking and even happier the rare times I manage to pitch a tent somewhere beautiful; like Yosemite National Park.  My musical taste is all over the map. From straight up jazz to 60's and 70's rock to music from all over the world.\r\n\r\nI have one daughter who has given me three super charged grandchildren, whom I just adore!  You may meet them during your stay with me.\r\n\r\nI look forward to meeting all of you who choose to visit my home.  You will find it to be very comfortable and peaceful.  Some guests have even described it as \"magical.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n",

My brain has also always been pretty curious so I have a very wide variety of interests from literature, philosophy, archaeology, science, the arts to the natural world (including a great love of animals).   I recently adopted a new rescue dog (a Saluki from Dubai) and have occasionally fostered other doggies :).\n\nThough  I am a vegetarian I have no problems with those around me cooking/eating meat.  While I can have a very busy schedule at times, I still love connecting with new people and  hearing about their lives through a good conversation.    \n\nOver the years, I've often been told I'm a good host as I love visitors and also love helping people discover all the \"inside\" cool places in the \nBay Area.

For example, within a pleasant 15-20 minute walk from your door are 78 well-reviewed eateries representing 21 ethnicities!  Several are just a 5-minute walk.<br /><br />Bikes and scooters are convenient to rent, and have safe, dedicated lanes to and from major transit.<br /><br />Morning coffee and great breakfast, casual and fine dining are around the corner or just a pleasant stroll from home.  <br /><br />A leisurely 15-20 minute walk takes you to lively Piedmont Avenue, where you'll find Oakl",

The best grocery store in the East Bay, Berkeley Bowl, is walking distance, and Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, and Safeway are close by, as are great restaurants, cafes, and bars. It is safe to walk to all of these places including at night.",

Our 19 year-old daughter lives at home, and my 26 year-old son lives close by and comes to visit pretty often.  So with all that the house is a busy (sometimes messy version of life) but all good. We aren't a pristine B&B -- just a homey home with kids, dogs and kitty cats.  I was once a chef and owned a catering business but now I work helping elders move into assisted living care. Amy my partner is a theater professional - former Artistic Director of the Playwrights Foundation in San Francisco.  So if you like theater, futbol, food and wine you have come to the right place. And Maggie the dog and Rosie & Mocha the cats welcome you too.  ",

I travel generally off the beaten track, usually with an adventure in mind - biking, rafting, hiking, camping, guiding tours in Latin America, curating art exhibits, studying art or languages, developing programs.  \n\nMy daughter and I have hosted many friends, foreign exchange students, and friends of friends over the years in Oakland.  I speak Spanish and some Portuguese (and English!).  My daughter has graduated from college & left the nest, so there is room in the inn at home now!  Like my great neighbors, I have owned a sweet house in Idora Park for a long time.  Home and garden projects keep me busy!\n\n We love the convenient walking distance to Temescal and Rockridge restaurants, farmers’ markets, monthly First Fridays - music and arts events, shops, bookstores, galleries, and transportation to San Francisco. SF is a 20 minute train ride away. A great place to stay in the Bay Area and be our guest!\n\nThings most important to me are friends, family, nature time, swimming, and learning. Activities that occupy my time are coordinating projects in immigrant communities in the Bay Area, assisting friends and family in need, dancing, bicycling, pilotes, yoga, making muffins at Green Gulch Zen farm and weekly dinners with friends from 1 to 90.",

Less than a mile to BART (0.9 miles) this centrally located apartment is perfect for commuting to downtown Oakland, Berkeley or San Francisco. Close to several supermarkets (Sprouts and Whole Foods), coffee shops, restaurants, beer gardens, theaters and wine bars. Very close to Lake Merritt, a great location for walks and runs and to the Oakland hills for longer hikes in the redwoods.",
      "neighborhood_overview": "The neighborhood is up and coming, situated between downtown Oakland and Berkeley. Within a few blocks are numerous restaurants, coffee shops with wi-fi, bars, a halal market, and public transportation.  <br /><br />Downtown Oakland is a vibrant area with music, night life, delicious restaurants and a thriving art scene. We recommend Burma Superstar for dining and visiting the New Parkway Theater for watching particular movies in a comfy couch while being served food. Also Lane Splitter is fantastic for a good pizza and the Scottish pub down the street has amazing beers and a great lamb pie.  <br /><br />Going west from the house is a little rough but east along Telegraph Ave is a great street all the way north to Berkeley and south to downtown Oakland. <br /><br />At times there are homeless encampments on the sidewalks nearby, especially along MLK Blvd or under the freeways. We have rarely had issues with these encampments but they can be a source of discomfort if this is your first ",

My home is appropriate for quiet, responsible, budget-minded travelers who enjoy privacy and like cats. Discounts for week and month-long stays!

      "neighborhood_overview": "We’re in the Golden Gate neighborhood of North Oakland, on the border of Emeryville and Berkeley. Just across the Bay is stunning San Francisco.<br /><br />This is a diverse community beginning to face the oncoming wave of gentrification that is spilling over from the San Francisco boom. My home and my neighborhood are politically progressive and socially tolerant. We celebrate differences and practice kindness. The neighbors are friendly. We have artists, students, professionals, blue collar workers, and retirees. My house is on a busy street, but if you walk along our side streets, you will find some lovely craftsman architecture and quirky urban gardens.<br /><br />Overall, this is a safe area, to the degree that any place is safe. People who are accustomed to urban living and have basic street smarts will feel comfortable here. A locked iron fence around our small property also helps with security.<br /><br />A short walk, bike, or bus ride  away you will discover wonderful ameniti",

So, you could see me futzing around the place with tools or a brush. I enjoy hiking in our beautiful East Bay regional parks (and beyond.) And, baby – I can cook!! You might easily find me in the kitchen rockin’ to indie folk music (or Golden Age musicals and Big Band) and making a batch of New Mexican posole! I love good beer and fine wine and spending time with Dolores laughing our butts off. I also enjoy the peace and solitude of our lovely little garden and you can find me and Dolores having coffee on the deck in the morning sun.  Professionally, I'm the Artists' Services Manager of the Merola Opera Program, contracted with San Francisco Opera.\n\nAbout Dolores: I received my PhD in Film Studies at UC Berkeley and currently teach online. My area of focus is \"divas\" (for real!), and enjoy a good cocktail, good conversation, and all the films of Catherine Deneuve. I love old movies, good music (all kinds – even opera), and anything strange or \"over-the-top.\" I'm looking forward to meeting you!",

Village life worldwide attracts me, from Nepal to Tibet to Peru, which is why airbnb appeals. It's the same friendly outreach among people of good will that works life's magic, turning strangers into friends. .    I enjoy a cozy and colorful setting, and love to share my home with others.  My motto is \"Ever Onward!\" because I can't live without ideas, inspiration, new writing projects, and of course, vegetables from Berkley Bowl! Striped ones, yellow ones, round ones, skinny ones, green leafy ones....mmm.  \r\n\r\nMy own travel is often trekking, stopping at guest houses, or traveling by bus, whether in Bulgaria or China. Having written a cookbook, I'm always looking out for new recipes and unusual foods, and find that friendly chats about local cuisine often develop into longer, informative discussions.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n",

You can see the beautiful animated neon sign for the landmark Vaudeville house turned movie palace The Grand Lake Theatre from the house, and you’re a block from the best rated Farmer’s Market in the East Bay. It’s a block to the lake, and 15 minutes walk around the lake to downtown. <br />In addition to plenty of green park area at Lake Merritt (where you'll find half of Oakland hanging out, BBQing, and relaxing in the grass on any nice day...and with the Mediterranean climate here and close to 300 days a year of sun, most days are nice days!), within",

We love hosting on Airbnb and have had some wonderful experiences as Airbnb guests - most recently during trips to Tulum, Montreal, Spain & Morocco. \n\nOur guest suite is a private, indoor-outdoor space that is separated from the main house by a deck.  We simplified the guest spaces to make it possible to follow cleaning and sanitizing best practices during this time. The spaces are now more minimal but still feel cozy. \n\nWe were students at UC Berkley and lived in San Francisco (and got married & had a baby) before moving to this special spot. We appreciate the wonderful diversity of people, food, art & nature found in Oakland and having been in the Bay Area for many years, we know it well.  We are more than happy to make recommendations for local restaurants, bookstores, shops, classes, hiking trails...looking for something else? We could probably make a recommendation for that too. :)\n\nWe are available if anything comes up and the separation between the main house and cottage provides our guests with space and privacy.\r\n\r\nWe offer a 10% discount for stays a month or longer.",

Dona Thomas, Pizzaiolo, and Burma Superstar are Zagat rated.

Bicycles and scooters are available, all local bus options and the free shuttle. The BART system connects you to the entire bay area. <br /><br />We are in a very urban and multicultural area with lots of street life and great neighbors. The location is extr",

We all know each other & help each other out.  I am 20 minutes (driving) to downtown SF.  This is a very family-oriented, residential, suburban neighborhood.  There's a gas station w/mini mart 4 blocks away.  Other than that, there are NO restaurants, cafes, grocery stores, etc to get food close by.  You will HAVE TO DRIVE TO GET FOOD. That, said, there are some fabulous, highly rated restaurants within a 10 minute drive. Also, Doordash/Postmates, Uber Eats are great food delivery services that I personally use.<br />Tons of street parking & gated parking is available for an additional fee. Also, please research \"Oakland, CA\" to get a better idea of where you're staying.  I am NOT in a \"safety challenged area\" - anywhere between Bancroft & San Leandro streets. It amazes me that people come out here and have no clue about the area, it's cultural makeup/ethnic diver",

My motto is \"Ever Onward!\" because I can't live without ideas, inspiration, new writing projects, and of course, vegetables from Berkley Bowl! Striped ones, yellow ones, round ones, skinny ones, green leafy ones....mmm.  \r\n\r\nMy own travel is often trekking, stopping at guest houses, or traveling by bus, whether in Bulgaria or China. Having written a cookbook, I'm always looking out for new recipes and unusual foods, and find that friendly chats about local cuisine often develop into longer, informative discussions.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n",

And never leave anything in your car in the Bay Area. <br /><br />This neighborhood is the most ethnically diverse zip code in the Bay Area. <br /><br />While this area is safe, a sketchier neighborhood is not far away (MacArthur at Seminary) and so we encourage our guests to steer clear of those areas. However, the hillside where we are is a lovely place to be. The houses on our block cost $1 million+.",

Brand new stainless steel gas range and full-sized fridge make cooking a breeze, or you can partake in booming Oakland's restaurant scene.",
      "neighborhood_overview": "Eastmont Hills is a diverse neighborhood of well-kept homes below the 580 freeway and several steep blocks above MacArthur boulevard. I've lived in Oakland since 1985 but only recently moved to this neighborhood, in 2017. I find new things to love about it every day! There is an open space park just a half a block away, great for stretching your legs, watching the sunset and taking in the view of Mt. Tamalpais in Marin, four bridges, and the Oakland and San Francisco Skylines. You can hear the mockingbirds singing and the owls hooting, see hawks hovering above the hillside and enjoy the brilliant magenta of bougainvillea that seems to thrive here.<br />To be transparent, it is East Oakland: you may hear occasional sirens from MacArthur Blvd down the hill or the momentary throb of bass from someone driving by enjoying their music a little loud; and you can't leave stuff in your car in plain view and expect it to be there in the morning. It's also not a super convenient neighborhood: pub",

It is centrally located in the San Francisco Bay Area, with easy access to many interesting places, a vibrant restaurant and arts scene, and rich ethnic, racial, and economic diversity.  It is important to note that Oakland, probably more than any other West Coast major city, has suffered in a disproportionate way from a housing crisis, with a significant and visible homeless population. These people are living in this neighborhood, a mere stone’s throw from homes that frequently cost one million dollars or more.<br /><br />Solutions to these complex issues are not completely clear, but please be aware that you will be staying in an urban environment, with all of the advantages and potential inconveniences that may imply.",

The street is tucked up on a hill away from the major thoroughfares, with sun and breeze and views of the Bay sparkling to the west and the city skyline to the north - but it's under 2 miles from downtown Oakland with its off -the-hook restaurant and club scene, street life, and BART connection to the broader Bay.   <br />Coming home from the bustling, challenging city I love feels like returning to an oasis of calm and peace. You're welcomed to join us there!",

I also very much enjoy sustainable organic gardening and trail maintenance.  I totally groove on cultural exchange.  For me, running this inn is a natural outgrowth of being a returned Peace Corps Volunteer (Ivory Coast, '97-99), speaking Spanish, French and German, and always looking for the most realistic and genuine reflection of a community when I travel abroad. I hope to reflect the best of Oakland to my guests, while learning some about the world from my guests and their experiences. ",

      "neighborhood_overview": "Much of Oakland's charm in my opinion is in its ethnic, race, class and political diversity, and the vibrant San Antonio district is a classic representation of this cross-section.  My neighbors come from many parts of the world but we share food, fruit, and greetings while we walk dogs and kids up the block.  The street is tucked up on a hill away from the major thoroughfares, with sun and breeze and views of the Bay sparkling to the west and the Downtown Oakland city skyline to the north - but it's under 2 miles from downtown Oakland with its off -the-hook restaurant and club scene, street life, and BART connection to the broader Bay.   <br />Coming home from the bustling, challenging city I love feels like returning to an oasis of calm and peace. You're welcomed to join us here!",

Since moving to the Bay Area I have enjoyed rowing crew on Lake Merritt, cycling the network of bike-friendly roads in the Bay Area, hiking and running with my 2 viszla dogs, and backpacking in the Sierra and elsewhere.  I also very much enjoy sustainable organic gardening and trail maintenance.  I totally groove on cultural exchange.  For me, running this inn is a natural outgrowth of being a returned Peace Corps Volunteer (Ivory Coast, '97-99), speaking Spanish, French and German, and always looking for the most realistic and genuine reflection of a community when I travel abroad. I hope to reflect the best of Oakland to my guests, while learning some about the world from my guests and their experiences. ",

      "neighborhood_overview": "This is an urban neighborhood, mostly residential.  There are eateries available during the day but dining in the evening is best sought in downtown Oakland or San Francisco, a short BART or Uber ride away.  BART is only one and a half blocks from our front door and you can reach either location in 10-15 minutes.",

Diamond Park and Saucel Creek great nature spots, 5 minute walk from my house. The weather is one of the finest in the United States as well as the Bay Area.

Rockridge is both a destination and a transportation hub. If you want to be in the East Bay, you can't beat this neighborhood.",

You can see the whole city lit up with incredible twilight in the background. <br /><br />This is a perfect spot for a mini getaway with friends or families!<br /><br />PS: the guest unit is downstairs and we live upstairs.

The early morning here is quiet with fresh cool air, perfect for that cup of coffee. Our neighbors are super friendly and always watch out for each other. There's a strong sense of true community here that you don't really get anywhere else in the bay. Our home is also centrally located in the East Bay so it's easy to get around.",

Quiet 2-block long street, with a private off-street parking space.<br /><br />Less than a mile (18-minute walk) to Fruitvale Bart station. A 22-minute train ride to San Francisco. <br /><br />Low-key foodie destination in the Fruitvale district where you can get tacos, falafel & hummus, or Cambodian food all within a block of each other.<br /><br />Near Red Bay Coffee (gourmet coffee roasters), and Jo's modern Thai. All this within 1 mile of the house.",
      "neighborhood_overview": "We live on a secure 2-block-long street that nobody really comes down (unless they live here) in the Fruitvale neighborhood. You'll be staying in a 1 bedroom 1 bathroom apartment in a 2-unit apartment building.<br /><br />This is a residential area near commercial streets with lots of restaurants, and near many artist live/work spaces. Fruitvale is diverse and home to a large immigrant population (predominantly Spanish-speaking).<br /><br />Fruitvale is home to people from all walks of life. It is a multicultural, urban, commercial district. We live near a transit hub so as you head towards the BART train station (~0.9 miles away), the neighborhood gets a bit gritty.<br /><br />People generally stay with us because we are close to BART, and major freeways 880 and 580, and we are an affordable Bay Area option, not necessarily to hang out in our neighborhood. Your booking has 1 off-street parking space for 1 vehicle so you can drive to and from the apartment with ease.<br /><br />Confide",

There are also lovely trails for hiking through a designated open space which overlooks the bay on one side, and the Oakland Hills on the other. <br /><br />Although it is a completely residential area, it is within minutes to destination locations (see Getting Around).",

I'm passionate about teaching and spreading the joy of dance, especially partner dance.  I also collect rare plants and have a beautiful and interesting (if a tad unruly) garden, which I tend to all by myself, hence the unruly part.  I love to cook, but my diet is pretty basic, mostly plants, simply prepared with very little processed foods.  I'm a good conversationalist, but my schedule is erratic, so no guarantee I'll be around when you want to talk.  Happy to supply you with all the info you want about the area!  I can't live without good friends, integrity, laughter, dancing, new things to try, and nature.  When I travel, it's usually dance related, although I did achieve my dream of an English country garden tour a few years ago.   I spent the month of July in Sweden and Norway for 8 years studying a European jazz dance (boogie woogie) that I fell in love with.  My home is a quiet space, good for people who want to rest when they get back to their room, not good for people who want to party in their room, rather than on the town. (Also not good for smokers.  Please see house rules if you smoke.)",

You will see a mix of graffiti, well maintained homes, neglected homes, industrial buildings, trains, and greeting dogs. Some travelers feel comfortable walking or jogging around the neighborhood as others prefer using uber/lyft/taxi. As we would in any city, we exercise caution and maintain awareness of our surroundings and we suggest that to guests. Experienced and confident travelers who like exposure to different cultures tend to love our neighborhood. If you are looking for a silent suburban feel this may not be the best place for you. Being centrally located and having a clean, high quality suite are just some of the many reasons why this may be the perfect place for you!<br /> <br />1 mile from the Oakland Coliseum/Bart<br />2 miles from the Oakland Zoo<br />3 miles from OAK airport<br />15 minutes from downtown Oakland/Lake Merritt<br /",

We have a lovely guesthouse with all sorts of thoughtful touches to make your stay comfortable and clean. We have upped our cleaning game to ensure a covid-safe environment. Our little cottage has a shower, Nespresso maker, microwave, small refrigerator, sink, heat and fun treats for those late night cravings. This would be a wonderful place for someone in need of some private R&R or a couple looking to explore the sights by day and rest by night. Oakland has SO much to explore- and our location maximizes convenience with some lesser known gems nearby as well. Less than a mile from 580 & 880 freeways, the up and coming Laurel District, and taco truck paradise in Fruitvale... what more could you want! Just north of us are the beautiful and undervalued Joaquin Miller trails. Alameda is a quick little drive down High street. Take a lyft to Fruitvale BART and head on to San Francisco in less than 20 minutes! \nExplore or restore, our little tiny home is neat and cheerful.\n\nThank you for reading- we look forward to making your stay as comfortable, informed, and respected as possible!\n\n\nWe hope you love the fun pops of color and charming style we have blended to make this space special! \n\nJust to clarify: your entry will be semi-private in that you will pass our main house as you make your way to the cottage! We have a gated entry with a code and several gated yards. You will be able to privately enter and depart as you please!",

      "description": "Our guest suite is in the Laurel district of Oakland and is centrally located for all the Bay Area adventures. The space is walking distance to local coffee shops, restaurants and breweries and is a quick drive to Joaquin Miller park for beautiful redwood hikes. We’re roughly a 20 minute drive from San Francisco and Berkeley with both easily accessible via public transit. Napa and wine country are less than an hour drive away. We hope you enjoy your stay in the Bay!",
      "neighborhood_overview": "We live in the Laurel District of Oakland which is a very family orientated neighbourhood. Our street is very peaceful with a nice community feel. Less than 5 minutes walk from our house is the heart of the Laurel with multiple restaurants, bars, coffee shops, retail stores and other businesses with some real local gems. The area is a bit hilly, but if you can handle that then there's some lovely parks close by to relax in and we are close to multiple other neighbourhoods in the area.",

People of different ethnicities, backgrounds and ages coexist peacefully. It’s only 7 blocks away from the crown joule of the city, the Lake Merritt, a place with magnificent views and architecture were Oaklanders gather for farmers’ market, strolling, salsa-dancing, acro-yoga, jogging, celebrating life, etc. <br /><br />Around the Lake there are plenty of coffee shops ",

You'll have a private parking space. <br /><br />Less than a mile (19-minute walk) to Fruitvale Bart station.

All this within 1 mile of the house.",
      "neighborhood_overview": "We live on a secure dead-end street that nobody really comes down (unless they live here) in the Fruitvale neighborhood. You'll be staying in a studio apartment in a 2-unit apartment building.<br /><br /><br />This is a residential area near commercial streets with lots of restaurants, and near many artist live/work spaces. Fruitvale is diverse and home to a large immigrant population (predominantly Spanish-speaking).<br /><br />Fruitvale is home to people from all walks of life. It is a multicultural, urban, commercial district. We live near a transit hub so as you head towards the BART train station (~0.9 miles away), the neighborhood gets a bit gritty.<br /><br />People generally stay with us because we are close to BART, and major freeways 880 and 580, and we are an affordable Bay Area option, not necessarily to hang out in our neighborhood. Your booking has 1 off-street parking space for 1 vehicle so you can drive to and from the apartment with ease.<br /><br />Confident travelers",

      "neighborhood_overview": "The Craftsman bungalow style home is located in the charming Heavencourt neighborhood.

There's an elementary school and public park across the street, as well as a row of Palm Trees to welcome you to California. From this neighborhood, there are many sightseeing areas to view the San Francisco skyline just a walk away. Within a 1-mile radius, you have a handful of dining options: from mom-and-pop authentic restaurants (e.g., Champa Garden thai food, Cam Huong vietnamese sandwiches, Pho Ao Sen vietnamese noodles, variety of Mexican food trucks) to adorable coffee shops (e.g., Arizmendi Bakery, Xochi The Dog Cafe, Rise & Grind Coffee, Haddon Hill Cafe). And if these options don't suit you, going to Downtown Oakland is just one bus stop away with the 62 bus right across the street!",

From West Oakland BART, it’s just 7-minutes to San Francisco’s financial district, 6-minutes to downtown Oakland, and 9-minutes to MacArthur BART near Emeryville. You can’t beat those commute times!<br />Prescott is also flat, making it very walkeable and bikeable (e.g., it’s about a 10 min bike ride to downtown Oakland). And it’s just a 7–10 minute drive to many awesome Oakland neighborhoods such as Temescal, Jack London Square, and Uptown.<br /><br />Prescott and West Oakland have some pretty awesome local businesses and nonprofits (currently and in the works). For restaurants, there’s Soba Ichi (handmade artisan Japanese soba noodles), Horn BBQ (headed up by renowned BBQ pitmaster Matt ",

      "neighborhood_overview": "We're in a neighborhood called Longfellow. It's kind of considered a part of \"NOBE\" (North Oakland, Berkeley, Emeryville). Since the pandemic, Oakland and much of the Bay Area has had a rise in homelessness and transients. The neighborhood is comprised of diverse working class families and people from all walks of life. The surrounding neighborhood is emerging and urban so we'd only recommend you book if you're comfortable in a big city/urban environment. We have many neighbors, some you'll never see and others that hang out in front of their homes. A little smile and hi go a long way. You'll encounter all sorts of things on the street; hipsters, yupsters, regular Joe's, homeless people, and trash/debris. In other words having STREET SMARTS and being comfortable with diversity are highly recommended. We're often asked about safety when booking or staying in Oakland, and it's not really a question we can answer for you since it's highly subjective. If you're seeking a more suburban feel",

      "neighborhood_overview": "Our neighborhood is an ever changing urban environment filled with long time residents and families, artists, urban farms, colorful graffiti art and the new wave of both hipsters and techies escaping the higher cost of living in SF. This is the old Jazz and Blues historical neighborhood of Oakland. It is predominantly residential with beautiful old Victorians, many of which are undergoing renovation as there has been a lot of renewed interest in the area recently, and some Industrial parts of the neighborhood. The proximity to BART and convenience this offers to all the tourist attractions and great restaurants / walking areas of the Bay Area is what draws people to this part.  This area has been a long time favorite for artists and musicians and is home to the Crucible and the American Steel creative spaces.  We have lived here for 20 years and love the area. Our little neighborhood is safe and also as close as you can get to BART, the little convenience markets on 7th st and Mandela ",

I've traveled to 50+ countries; much of it solo backpacking, and love hearing about people's stories and lives. \n\n It's great to have you in my space and I'm excited to share Oakland with you. The neighborhood is diverse and this is one of the reasons why I love it; BIPOC, LGBTQA+ and others are welcome in my home and in this community. \n\nAs a guest, I'm clean and quiet :) As a host, I'm brand new! Looking forward to having you here. \n\nThanks!\nMelissa",

Perfect for short term cozy stays where you can afford to have a bit of company.<br /><br />I designed & renovated the entire house about a year ago - every single wall was touched in effort of creating my perfect work-from-home oasis. The bathroom is to die for & the kitchen is a chefs kitchen with everything you might possibly need. I'm hardly around so you'll get your bit of privacy too!",
      "neighborhood_overview": "This is a great opportunity to live in the established neighborhood of Havenscourt out of Oakland, CA. Close to schools, shopping, restaurants, BART, and the freeway makes the location desirable. With Oracle Arena and Oakland Coliseum a mile and a half away, this location is perfect for attending events but far enough away where you won't be in the thick of traffic and commotion from events.",

The weather here is sunny specially in spring and summer without the cool breeze from the bay. IN the fall you see fall colors that does not happen often in the bayarea. THe neighborhood is walking distance to Monclair village ( 30 min) that has great restuarants, coffe shops and cute small stores. It is 5 min drive to College Avenue in Rockridge that again has tons of options in well rated restaurants and great local shops. With car you are no more than 20-25 min from San Francisco downtown when the traffic is light. All in all a safe friendly, quite neighborhood that has great connectivity.",

I bought a bunch of tools I didn’t know how to use, watched a lot of YouTube and Fixer Upper, and learned as I went! The vision was to create a cozy space where mid-century meets modern farmhouse. I hope you enjoy staying here as much as I enjoyed designing it and fixing it up! It truly makes my heart so happy when this sweet cottage gets to welcome new guests from all around the world. I want you to walk in and feel like you’ve entered an oasis where you can relax and make new memories with loved ones. Build a fire, break out some board games, settle in an Adirondack chair to read a book, cook group meals in a magazine-worthy Chef’s kitchen, grill outside and play lawn games, strum on the guitar in the living room — this space was meant to bring people together, and we hope you use every inch of it! <3",

The area is located on the northwest side of Broadway, between the City Center complex and the Jack London Square district, and across Broadway from Chinatown.<br /><br />The Old Oakland district was the \"original\" downtown Oakland during the 1860s after Central Pacific Railroad constructed a terminus on 7th Street. By the 1870s, elegant brick Victorian hotels were being built in the blocks surrounding the railroad station to accommodate travelers. The ground floor of the hotels were designed as series of narrow shops so that pedestrians would pass by many of them just walking down the block. The architectural styles of the time featured tall, cast-iron columns and large plate-glass windows.<br /><br />In its early days, the Oakland Tribune rented a small office on 9th Street. A sign for the Tribune office can still be seen hanging outside the building today (2007). A farmer'",

      "description": "This one-bedroom apartment is part of a larger home; however, it is completely segregated with its own entrance, and even its own separate, gated, private backyard. Therefore, you will be sharing absolutely nothing with the occupants of the bigger part of the home. Aside from its designated parking space (off-the-street) this charming and spacious one bedroom is in a cul de sac; which guaranties a very nice and quite environment. It is a very desirable place for all stays of any terms.",
      "neighborhood_overview": "Oakland has become one of the youngest cities in all California. Young professionals prefer it not only because is substantially less expensive than our famous neighboring city, but also because it offers the most flavorful array of entertainment and eateries of the entire area at a fraction of what your pay across the Bay.  <br /><br />In terms of the neighborhood where your apartment is located, true diversity is the first phrase that comes to mind when trying to define “Fruitvale District” (name of this section of town). People of different ethnicities, backgrounds and ages coexist peacefully. It’s only a short drive/bike or an economical uber-ride from the crown joule of the city, the Lake Merritt, a place with magnificent views and architecture were Oaklanders gather for farmers’ market, strolling, salsa-dancing, acro-yoga, jogging, celebrating life, etc. <br /><br />Fruitvale is the Latino neighborhood of Oakland. Not far from apartment, nearing intersections of Fruitvale at Foot",

We know all of our neighbors by name, and you'll often see kids running around the nearby cul-de-sac, people out walking their dogs. Everyone generally being super friendly and neighborly. That being said, this is an urban environment, so it's best to keep general safety guidelines in mind. <br /><br />There are two incredible grocery stores within a mile (The Mill & Farmer Joe's), and we are within a mile of a dozen or so restaurants and breweries. Some of our favorites: Jo's Modern Thai and Wawa's (Thai), Degree's Plato & Ghosttown (breweries), Raymond's Nudough (Vietnamese), La Farine (boulangerie) and Sequoia Diner (brekkie). There's also incredible latin cuisine in the nearby Fruitvale neighborhood, and we personally love Obelisco.<br /><br />The best part of Oakland is that you're close to the hustle and bustle but also super close to some of the best hikes, mountain bikin",

You can hear the Mills College bells ring each quarter hour. <br /><br />Our neighbors include a ferry boat captain, a famous Mission mural painter, digital consultants for political campaigns, and a wellness oriented chiropractor. <br /><br />Almost all of the buildings on our street are single family, middle class homes ($1M in the Bay Area) occupied by long time residents. These include Asian, Latino, black, and white residents and families - we are the most ethnically diverse zip code in the Bay Area. You'll see them all walking dogs on the street. <br /><br />There's a wonderful natural foods grocery store about 10 minutes away by car - Farmer Joe's has two locations. Further away, there are many other great purveyors - Berkeley Bowl and Rockridge Market Hall. <br /><",

I've always used Airbnb when traveling so it's been quite an adventure creating my own listings. I've had the opportunity to meet people from all over the world, and make some lasting friendships.\n\nMy friend Eric and I banded together to purchase our home here in Berkeley last year and are using Airbnb to help afford the mortgage while we make improvements to the property. We both also have full-time jobs and work from home so we'll for sure get a chance to talk.\n\nLook forward to meeting you!\n\nNate\n\nNeed a car too? Check out my car rental options on Turo! Airbnb doesn't allow links to be shared in profiles but just message me or search the area on Turo, if I have a car available I'll beat any other comparable (model, year) and confirmed rental price!",
