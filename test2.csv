Guests love it here for the peaceful environment and the private outdoor space! Great for travel nurses, people needing a place to work remotely, or if you're looking for more permanent housing.

      "neighborhood_overview": "Oakland is often called “The Brooklyn of the Bay.” The West Oakland neighborhoods are old and transitioning and serve all walks of life — blue-collar, artists, activists, families, retired, tech, and students. You name it. <br /><br />The neighborhood is gritty and beautiful at the same time. You’ll find things like street art, food trucks, greasy spoons, community gardens, an aerial arts studio, and a dog daycare, all mixed in with hints of our Black Panther roots. <br /><br />The neighborhood is not for everyone. If you are looking for luxury, this may not be your place. West Oakland is an emerging, urban atmosphere. It's plenty safe but considered unpolished by some standards. There is sometimes litter and often unhoused people around BART stations, including ours. If that puts you off, you might not love it here. <br /><br />What we lack in a pristinely manicured, upscale neighborhood, we make up for in character. And you can't beat the proximity to BART and, well, everywhere!<br /",

      "neighborhood_overview": "Once a shopping district in the early 20th century, Uptown is the hottest neighborhood in Oakland. A new restaurant, indie boutique, or bar seemingly opens every other week, with nearly 125 opened in the past decade. Billed as the arts and entertainment district of Oakland, it fulfills its promise, particularly during the boisterous Art Murmur on First Fridays. But the prettiest art may be the Art Deco buildings themselves, with the crown jewels being the show stopping Fox and the Paramount theaters. The former is mostly a live music venue; the latter channels its inner flapper often (classic movies with a live organ player). Art galleries, run by the artists or by volunteers, are opening in brick warehouses. Down side streets are scenes of the start-up, DIY revolution with co-ops, an urban winery, entrepreneur hubs, and creative centers.",

There's ample street parking, but between walking, buses and BART, you don't need a car. The Berkeley campus is just two miles north, and downtown Oakland is just three miles south.",

This 2BR/1BA is located in Jack London Square, steps to urban wineries, breweries, restaurants, coffee and the renowned Oakland waterfront. <br /><br />Perfect location in Oakland (~10 min walk to Ferry to San Francisco ~20 min ferry ride) — 7 blocks from BART (~10min walk).  2 blocks from Amtrak. Quick access to all the major highways in the bay area.",
      "neighborhood_overview": "Jack London Square is a historic waterfront and industrial hub that continues to grow. Container ships, ferry boats, kayaks and SUPs maneuver through the harbor lined with breweries, urban wineries, coffee, and restaurants. There is an urban winery tour (link below) you can take if you can't make it to Napa! Don't miss out on the farmers/crafts market every Sunday or taking sunset walks along the boardwalk.<br /><br />Named after the legendary American novelist, Jack London worked on novels at the oldest bar in Oakland--Heinold's First and Last Chance Saloon (right on the waterfront). Built in 1883, it was a staple for incoming sailors and dock workers. Have beer here for historical sake, but if you love beer there are incredible breweries throughout the neighborhood (personal favorite is Pattern Brewery which is right across the street from the loft). They serve dumplings from the popular Good to Eat Dumplings.",

There are 2 adjoining bedrooms in a worn but lovely craftsman home, with a fireplace and a large backyard deck, and within a couple blocks of a butcher, bakery (alas, no candlestick maker), ice cream shop, bar, supermarket, cafes, restaurants and boutiques. It's a 10 minute walk to BART, which takes 20 minutes into SF. UC Berkeley is a 30 minute walk and less than a 10 minute drive away. I enjoy hosting and am eager to help.",

Rockridge doesn't just have to serve as a base from which you can explore the Bay, it is a destination in and of itself. Any quick search will yield many things to do in the area and I'm happy to provide guidance in that regard. Immediately to the west you find the hipster haven Temescal and just to the north you find similarly comfortable Berkeley neighborhood Elmwood. UC Berkeley and hill hiking is also close by.",

The night life and restaurant scene in Oakland is great! There is so much going on, I never had a dull moment living here. Our kids love going to Fairyland and Lakeside Park. It's a convenient and safe neighborhood, with much great culture to experience. We hope you come see Oakland soon!",

      "host_about": "I currently live in Oakland but originally came from Vietnam with my family in 1981. I grew up in Boston, MA and graduated from Boston University with a Bachelor Degree’s in Finance. After graduation, I moved to the Seattle area for a year but decided to settle in Oakland in 1992, where I raised my two sons, who are now adults.\nI enjoy dancing, checking out real estate, skiing, traveling, wine tasting, and listening to live music, or simply cooking for my family and friends. Why cooking? I enjoy hosting a small party because I enjoy setting a pretty table, playing with the lighting and music, stocking the bathroom with cute items, and making my cocktail and dinner menus. These are all a sort of an artistic exercise that I find very satisfying. It’s a lot of work but it’s just very nice to see everyone dolled up and happy. At the end of the party, I feel I’ve contributed my gift to everyone, especially to my family and friends. I consider myself a great cook and a great bartender. One of things I enjoy most to make is seafood; I also love to mix cocktails with fresh herbs before dinner and then serve red wine at dinner. I know seafood is not supposed to pair with red wine but I like drinking red wine with anything. Who wouldn’t like it, right?\nSince I am an empty nester and a world traveler, I have always been looking for new places to travel and eat. When I travel whether domestically and internationally or whether staying in a hotel or an Airbnb, I do pay a lot attention to cleanliness and comfort, amenities, and the location of the stay. My utmost priority is a comfortable bed and cleanliness. I don’t smoke. I am very tidy, clean, and respectful with my surroundings. I take my world traveling, dining out, cooking and hosting experience into consideration to provide the ultimate guest experience at my place for you. ",

I'm also honored to have over 250 great reviews on Airbnb. While we accept shorter reservations, we specialize in providing furnished homes for 1-12 months, and have noticed many of our customers are business travelers and travel nurses. And we know what they want!\r\n\r\nSafe homes with amenities and transportation nearby, close to work, good office chair & desk for working at home, easy check-in without coordinating schedules, large WiFi connected TV's with Netflix to relax, personalized recommendations to meet like-minded folks, access to outdoor and fitness areas... and plenty more. As a former employee traveling for work in the finance industry, I realized that staying in hotels for long periods wasn't all it was chalked up to be... and that I could help provide a better experience for other travelers also. \r\n\r\nI've hosted hundreds of guests from around the US and world, and have studios to 2 bedroom apartments around the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley: \r\n- Mountain View\r\n- San Jose\r\n- Redwood City\r\n- Oakland (quick commute to San Francisco)\r\n- Richmond\r\n\r\nSend me a message and let's see what we can find closest to your work that meets your needs.\r\n\r\nI LOVE the San Francisco Bay Area, and I want you to also! I've lived here for over a decade, and there may be no other place in the world that offers the mix of opportunity, great weather, beautiful nature, urban activities, events, concerts, sporting events, and all kinds of great people.\r\n\r\nI'll provide you my own local guide of activities, meetups for your personal interests, and do my best to enjoying your time in the Bay, being productive, staying active, and making the most of your time here (or you're welcome to relax.. we're just here when you need us.)\r\n\r\nI have personally stayed in over 25 different Airbnb apartments around the US and the world, so I also know a thing or two about what makes a great furnished home and host. And will do my best to provide that to you. \r\n\r\nA little more about me personally: I've lived in California my whole life, and graduated from San Francisco State University, with a major in Economics and minor in Finance. I've lived all over the Bay Area, including most of the homes I host on Airbnb. I used to work for the State of California in bank regulation, before providing furnished homes and great stays to my guests full-time. \r\n\r\nI enjoy learning and sharing with other Airbnb hosts and real estate investors. In my free time, I also enjoy water color painting, karaoke, beaches, traveling, and making people happy :) \r\n\r\nI realize the San Francisco Bay Area gets very busy and can be quite pricey relative to other locations, so please send me a message so I can see what affordable home we can get you, before everything gets booked up. Thank you for your time. ",

      "host_about": "I currently live in Oakland but originally came from Vietnam with my family in 1981. I grew up in Boston, MA and graduated from Boston University with a Bachelor Degree’s in Finance. After graduation, I moved to the Seattle area for a year but decided to settle in Oakland in 1992, where I raised my two sons, who are now adults.\nI enjoy dancing, checking out real estate, skiing, traveling, wine tasting, and listening to live music, or simply cooking for my family and friends. Why cooking? I enjoy hosting a small party because I enjoy setting a pretty table, playing with the lighting and music, stocking the bathroom with cute items, and making my cocktail and dinner menus. These are all a sort of an artistic exercise that I find very satisfying. It’s a lot of work but it’s just very nice to see everyone dolled up and happy. At the end of the party, I feel I’ve contributed my gift to everyone, especially to my family and friends. I consider myself a great cook and a great bartender. One of things I enjoy most to make is seafood; I also love to mix cocktails with fresh herbs before dinner and then serve red wine at dinner. I know seafood is not supposed to pair with red wine but I like drinking red wine with anything. Who wouldn’t like it, right?\nSince I am an empty nester and a world traveler, I have always been looking for new places to travel and eat. When I travel whether domestically and internationally or whether staying in a hotel or an Airbnb, I do pay a lot attention to cleanliness and comfort, amenities, and the location of the stay. My utmost priority is a comfortable bed and cleanliness. I don’t smoke. I am very tidy, clean, and respectful with my surroundings. I take my world traveling, dining out, cooking and hosting experience into consideration to provide the ultimate guest experience at my place for you. ",

Includes one free underground parking space.You can get to downtown San Francisco by public transportation in less than 13 min and 22 min by car!\"",
      "neighborhood_overview": "Once a shopping district in the early 20th century, Uptown is the hottest neighborhood in Oakland. A new restaurant, indie boutique, or bar seemingly opens every other week, with nearly 125 opened in the past decade. Billed as the arts and entertainment district of Oakland, it fulfills its promise, particularly during the boisterous Art Murmur on First Fridays. But the prettiest art may be the Art Deco buildings themselves, with the crown jewels being the show stopping Fox and the Paramount theaters. The former is mostly a live music venue; the latter channels its inner flapper often (classic movies with a live organ player). Art galleries, run by the artists or by volunteers, are opening in brick warehouses. Down side streets are scenes of the start-up, DIY revolution with co-ops, an urban winery, entrepreneur hubs, and creative centers.",

The space is dog-friendly and has french doors to a private patio with full access to a fenced yard for your pup. With a private entrance, you'll feel at ease nestled in this quiet and cute neighborhood, but you'll be tempted by plenty of Oakland entertainment just steps away, such as the Oakland Rose Garden, Lake Merritt, and the Piedmont and Grand Lake dining districts.",
      "neighborhood_overview": "The neighborhood around the Rose Garden is the perfect quiet neighborhood nook surrounded by plenty of walkable attractions. There is plenty of free street parking, although the roads are narrow and a bit steep in places. The neighborhood is safe, with many dogs, cats, and children in the area. This area of Oakland has warmer weather than nearby cities or neighborhoods. It's common for locals to spend an evening chatting on a patio or deck. The house is a few blocks from a (truck-free) freeway, which comes with occasional noise pollution, but this block is particularly peaceful. The rose garden is less than 2 blocks away and is a lovely place to take your morning coffee and smell the roses.",

      "name": "2BR Large Heritage House - Close to all!",
      "description": "The house is large, has all the amenities, and is decorated with art from my travels. Large bedroom, private bathroom + half bath, parking on premises, backyard and patio. Airport rides provided for a fee. This is my home, not a permanent rental and you'll feel it immediately. I love to share it. Built in 1907, this is a registered Heritage House in Oakland. The house is @ the crossroads of Oakland, Berkeley & Emeryville. Close to everything! Dogs allowed if they don’t shed.",
      "neighborhood_overview": "I love my neighbors and friends on the street.  Everyone knows each other!  We're really close to everything - downtown Oakland, Jack London Square, Temescal, Berkeley, Emeryville and even Lake Merritt.  I recommend downloading Lyft or Uber on your phone for short trips around the East Bay. Super close, easy access to Berkeley and SF on the F bus (2 blocks away). I take it daily to work in SF. <br /><br />You will be very close to Temescal with all it’s delicious restaurants and cute shops - including Esquelito, Crimson Hort, Ali Golden (sharp women’s clothing) Standard & Strange (sharp men’s clothing), Rose’s Taproom, Burma Superstar, Pizzaiolo, Hawking Bird and Curbside Creamery. The area is funky, diverse and safe. We just got a Whole Foods.",

Many people swim, windsurf, and exercise on this sandy stretch and the sunsets are unbelievable! There are many parks and a handful of yacht clubs as well as many little neighborhood retail areas to explore. <br /><br />Down the Embarcadero which you can either walk, drive, or better yet- ride a bike is the new Brooklyn Basin- an open space park where you'll find a diverse group of people roller skating, celebrating birthday parties, and grabbing something to eat from the special grocery/cafe on site. Further down a few blocks is Jack London Square which is bustling with people enjoying a movie, all of the res",

This spacious, rustic 2 bedroom 1 bath space will inspire creativity and a perspective you may have never had before, as it feels like an art gallery with the hand painted piano, an artsy tree, a loft bed, and a church pew. Remember you are living like an artist, so it is a bit rustic and unfinished in places.",

Close to a creek and an urban forrest with lots of oak trees and redwoods and eucalyptus, worth exploring on an early evening walk. Grocery stores are on the same block, cafes and gyms. Public transit is abundant on Broadway a block away, and you can rent bikes in the vicinity of Sprouts, two blocks away.",

I love to travel and I am always looking for opportunities to take work on the road, especially creatively, through a love of photography, music, literature and bicycles. Naturally. \r\n\r\nWe live in and rent out our home in the Cleveland Heights neighborhood of Oakland California where my daughter Paloma represents the fifth generation to live in the home! We love to share our space with others while we travel! \r\nWith serendipity as a cornerstone, we prefer to travel along loose plans to let the day be the day and the night be the night. We love to experience other cultures, other people, and life as a wondrous series of events, and hope that folks will find this ethos in the very home we love and rent. ",

When not hanging off a cliff, you can find me in a yoga pose, lost in the great outdoors, or deep in a psychology book trying to figure out why people are the way that they are. Likes: art, thrifting, museums, yoga, climbing, and kindness. Looking forward to hosting fellow adventurers, yogis, thinkers, and music enthusiasts!",
